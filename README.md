## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* In this project, I used whatever tips and tricks I learnt in the last challenge. Hopefully the code is more accessible for all screen sizes as well as for assistive technologies.
* I had a few problems that I solved in a not-so-ideal manner but it is what I could do with my current knowledge. I got some advice on how my HTML should be but it mentioned a few things I was not familiar with, so because of that I didn't implement them. My hope is once I learn those concepts and properties, I can come back and do this challenge properly
* For now, I think my design looks quite close to the original, even if the code behind it is messy and not-ideal.
* I also used CSS Custom Properties for the first time. I don't think it was needed, I just wanted to use them. I want to come across a situation where they will be helpful.

### Continued development

I am really struggling with spacing, layouts, using Flexbox and Grid, stuff like that. Even pseudo classes. I hope I can continue to learn about them more in the future.
